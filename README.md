# ClassMatesFaceDetection
Created a face detector function that outputs class members and location. Use of SVM, Decision Trees and Random Forests

Obtained a Distinction garde for the project (79.5%).


RecogniseFace is the main function.

There are 2 feature extraction techniques used on 3 different classifiers.
SURF was trained through the bag of features approach.

SVM with HOG features produced the best results (99% accuracy on the training set).
